# ✈️ Airline Ticket Price Analysis (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes airline ticket data to uncover insights about pricing trends, passenger patterns, and travel routes.  
Using **Power BI**, I created interactive visualizations that answer key business questions for better decision-making in the aviation industry.

## 🎯 Objectives
The analysis focuses on answering the following questions:
1. **Which airlines have the highest passenger counts and average ticket prices?**  
2. **Which source and destination cities have the most frequent flights?**  
3. **How does ticket price change as the departure date approaches?**  
4. **How do flight duration and number of stops affect ticket price?**  
5. **What is the monthly trend of passenger traffic and average ticket prices?**

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – for data cleaning, modeling, and visualization
- **DAX** – for creating calculated columns and measures
- **Excel/CSV** – for initial dataset storage

## 📈 Key Visuals
- **Bar Charts** – Airline-wise passenger and price comparison
- **Map Chart** – Most frequent flight routes
- **Line Chart** – Price trends over time
- **Scatter Chart** – Duration/stops vs. price relationship
- **Area Chart** – Monthly passenger and pricing trends

## 📂 Dataset

  - Airline name  
  - Source city
